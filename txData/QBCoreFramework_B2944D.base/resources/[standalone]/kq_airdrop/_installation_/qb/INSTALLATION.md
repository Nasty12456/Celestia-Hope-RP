### Step 1:
Put the folder into your resources folder

### Step 2:
Enable the correct framework in the config.

### Step 3:
Add the items to your qb-core shared.lua file `qb-core/shared/items.lua` or `qb-core/shared.lua`

### Step 4:
Ensure the script in your `server.cfg` file. Make sure that it's started **after** your framework and kq_lootareas

### Step 5: (IMPORTANT)
Modify the loot items, as those are just placeholders and are not included in the items file!

### Done
Enjoy the script
